Kurta or top can be worn almost everywhere now. Choose cut, materials and work according to the environment. From teenagers to forty-somethings are now comfortable in this dress. Fashion houses also vary in offering all kinds of cuts, from indigenous to western. The same kurta can be worn with pants of different cuts to break the monotony. Kurtas are still loosely cut. Buyers are showing interest in soft fabrics and less work. This is useful in this climate. Loose long or short kurtas, tops or shirts are also trending. Both style and comfort are available on busy days.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"print-adslot adsBox _4Pk8L _0Zwdj\">\n<div class=\"dfp-ad-unit Tlph-\" data-lang=\"\u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09cd\u099e\u09be\u09aa\u09a8\">\n<div class=\"adunitContainer\">\n<div id=\"News_InArticle_300x250-9e3d4d73-634f-4c9f-aed0-a50fc91f66a3-0-0\" class=\" adBox\" data-google-query-id=\"CLyc4MW984EDFfxQnQkd0UgGfQ\"><span>This type of tunic is very ideal during any festival. <\/span><span>Made of viscose satin, the top is comfortable to wear even in hot weather. <\/span><span>A festive atmosphere has also come due to the colors. <\/span><span>The golden chumki work done near the neck has given a gorgeous look. <\/span><span>Chumki has red, beige and white thread work. <\/span><span>Apart from block print all over the top there is machine and hand work. <\/span><span>Bishop cut is predominant in sleeve cut. <\/span><span>Being loose will also make you feel comfortable.<\/span>As the color and design of the top is light, it can be worn during the day.
