This report was published in the esteemed Lancet Neurology journal.<\/p>\n<p>The report underscores that stroke deaths are expected to surge from 6.6 million in 2020 to a daunting 9.7 million by 2050. By 2050, it is estimated that the contribution of stroke deaths in LMICs will see an increase from 86 per cent to 91 per cent<\/p>\n<p>The report has emphasised the critical role of evidence-based, pragmatic solutions in combating this looming crisis.
