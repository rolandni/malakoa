However, according to Iranian authorities, Masa died of an old, unknown illness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masa Amini was awarded the Shakharov Award posthumously in October this year. It is the EU&#8217;s highest human rights award. The global movement started around Massa&#8217;s death was also jointly awarded the award.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AFP spoke to Masa Amini&#8217;s family lawyer Shirin Ardakani in France yesterday.

This led to a global movement called &#8216;Women, Life, Freedom&#8217;. The movement called for Iran to lift the hijab requirement for women and for the country to end its &#8220;Muslim cleric-led&#8221; government.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian security forces have repressed these protests. Hundreds of people were killed. Several people have also been executed in Iran. They were sentenced to death for their involvement in the protests. The Iranian authorities called the protest a &#8216;riot&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shakharov&#8217;s prize is due to be presented at a ceremony at the European Parliament on December 13. The prize money is 50 thousand euros.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Massa Amini&#8217;s family members could not go to France to receive the posthumous human rights award.
